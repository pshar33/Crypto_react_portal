# Inecta Crypto Portal

This project was created with React JS and by using the Coingecko API for fetching free Crypto data. 
I installed axios to get the data from the Coingecko Crypto API. The landing page content shows the top 100 crypto currencies in decreasing order of their current price.
The content area of the landing pages shows:-
- Image of crypto currency
- Name
- Current price ( in CAD )
- Price Change (in % )
- Market Cap

The Sidebar shows 5 different page options. There is no Onclick event present if the user attempts to click on them.

### `Use npm start`

To run the app and Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
